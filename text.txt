The politics behind the scenes
As ever, politics also played a part.
The Americans had signalled their willingness to do a deal some time ago. In August last year, Ambassador Kennedy publicly suggested a plea deal could be a resolution to the stand-off, a suggestion ultimately picked up by Mr Assange’s lawyers.
And in April, Mr Biden said he was considering a request from Australia to drop the prosecution.
US diplomats were keen to protect relations with Australia, with which it had agreed – along with the UK - the so-called Aukus defence and security partnership.
The Assange case had been a long-standing irritant in UK-US relations many diplomats were keen to square off.
Speculation grew that the Biden administration wanted the issue resolved before the presidential election in November, and some Assange supporters even suggested the US feared a Labour government in the UK would be less willing to agree to his extradition.
The White House was quick to say on Tuesday that it had played no part in the details of the plea deal - that was a matter for the Department of Justice
